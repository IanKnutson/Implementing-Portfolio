    <hr>
                <p1 style="color: black; text-align: left; font-size: larger; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">The problem with making armored characters look cool is that far too many suits of plate armor in sci-fi and fantasy are designed by artists who themselves have developed a distorted and bulky idea of "cool" by rotely apeing the designs of prior artists that ALSO didn't know about the historical equipment's precision engineering, elegance, and flexibility. Before firearm's increasing prevalence made it vanish for a long age, armorsmithing had elevated into not merely an art form, but a precise science intertwined with the art. Pauldrons are not formless, unbending watermelons that would hopelessly restrict the arms' movement, as depicted in Warhammer 40,000; they are articulated exoskeletons with many segments for range of motion. Helmets have specific types of visors to guard against specific forms of attack or environmental hazard. NOT ONE historical Armet, Sallet, or Burgonet helmet ever had the "Barbecue Spatula" seen on many a cartoon knight. It stands to logical reason that the only way to see more of armor designs that genuinely please me is to work toward developing skills for designing them myself. I can only stand so much of the same tired, anti-historical hulks.</p1>
